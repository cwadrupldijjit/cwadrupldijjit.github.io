<h2>
	Welcome to the project site for the Angular 2 Parallax Directive.
</h2>

<p class="note">
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> You can use this directive right now if you write Angular 2 code either with TypeScript or if you're writing ES5/6 code using SystemJS to import the directive. The versions for ES5 and Dart are not yet ready to use, but as demand grows for those as well as the documentation gets updated, those versions will be made available.

	<h3 id="installation">Installation of files</h3>
	<p>
		In order to install this plugin, you can do one of a few things:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			From your command line, type:
			<code>git clone https://github.com/cwadrupldijjit/ng2-parallax</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			Download it from one of the links above.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="note">
		<strong>NOTE:</strong> The plan is to publish this component on npm as ng2-parallax, but it's undergoing some testing and feedback before that happens.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		In any case, put the file in a convenient place to reference your ng2 directives in your file system, and then make sure the rest of your files are aware of it. For TypeScript, you can import it like so:
	</p>
	
	<div gist gistId="ts-imports"></div>
	<p>
		In both TypeScript and JavaScript, as long as you have autocompleting enabled for your text editor of choice, if you import both Parallax and ParallaxConfig, you can get some typings for the parallaxConfig object you can define in your component's class.  This is convenient for error checking and quicker autocompletion.
	</p>

<div>
	<h3>Add it to your component</h3>
	
	<p>
		In order to get your component to recognize it, you need to add it to your component's annotations like so:
	</p>
	<!--<code data-gist-id="30363937"></code>-->
	<div gist gistId="ts-add-directive"></div>
	<p>
		Or:
	</p>
	<!--<script src="https://gist.github.com/cwadrupldijjit/31db105441c5f416986e.js"></script>-->
	<div gist gistId="ts-add-directive-alt"></div>
	
	<p>
		You can then use the directive anywhere within that component itself by sticking it on any element you've put in your template like so:
	</p>
	
	<!--<script src="https://gist.github.com/cwadrupldijjit/b9430fb819a9b8b926bd.js"></script>-->
	<div gist gistId="add-to-html"></div>
</div>
<div>
	<p>
		This plugin assumes you've added styling to the element you've put the "parallax" attribute onto, like height, width, and background-image. If you'd like to override any of the default settings for the parallax directive when you'd like to customize the functionality. One way you can do that is by passing in a [config] object through the HTML.
	</p>
	<!--<script src="https://gist.github.com/cwadrupldijjit/41fbd1992acf9ad39a2f.js"></script>-->
	<div gist gistId="customize-parallax"></div>
	<p>
		For more specific information, refer to the example index.html found in the examples folder for the version of the plugin you'd like to use. Currently, only the TypeScript version works. The JS version is under development and the Dart version will happen later, when demand is up for it (or when it's requested and I have time to learn Dart... :P).
	</p>

		Any feedback is much appreciated. Log issues, send pull requests, you know the drill.
